# Vista-IOT Architecture

Overview of the Vista-IOT platform architecture and core components.

## System Overview

Vista-IOT is designed as a modular, scalable IoT platform with the following key components:

### Core Components

1. **Device Management Layer**
   - Device registration and authentication
   - Firmware update management
   - Device health monitoring

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Real-time data ingestion
   - Stream processing
   - Data validation and filtering

3. **Storage Layer**
   - Time-series database for sensor data
   - Configuration storage
   - User data management

4. **API Layer**
   - RESTful APIs
   - WebSocket connections for real-time data
   - GraphQL endpoint for complex queries

## Data Flow

```
IoT Devices → Message Broker → Processing Engine → Storage → API → Frontend
```

## Scalability

The platform is designed to handle thousands of concurrent device connections and can be horizontally scaled using containerization.
